This is something I started doing in my free time. Being a student from a non-computer science background, I did not have much knowledge about software development. So I started this project, the aim of which is to provide you with the details of the books using the google books API. For now the testing is done using a MongoDB database which contains some dummy books, just in order to have some data to test out the search functionality, favorites, etc.
